## Chaos Kitchen: A Culinary Adventure

### Game Description

We used Overcooked2 as the prototype of the game, based on which we added a character such as a mouse to interfere with the player's cooking process, and at the same time set up movable platforms in the game interface to increase the difficulty of the game. In addition, we also adjusted the customer settings and the props purchasing mechanism.

### Challenges

- Insufficient Game Content

   - The limited number of levels and lack of variety leave players without motivation to continue after completing the game.

- Balance Between Randomness and Difficulty

  - Random events add fun but may disrupt strategic planning; increasing difficulty needs to accommodate both beginners and advanced players.

- Lack of Rewards and Long-Term Goals

  - The current reward system is too basic to provide long-term incentives, leaving players with little motivation to unlock new content.
 
## RIFT

### Game Description

We take the Spelunky game as a prototype, based on which we add exploration elements through the design and change of the environmental background; in terms of enemy design, we change the singularity of the enemy's attack form through the design of props.

### Challenges

- Technical Challenges

  - Procedural generation must ensure that random maps are both playable and balanced
 
- Collision detection

  - It requires optimization for smoother gameplay

- Content Expansion

  - Introducing new features boss battles, and buff mechanisms, along with diverse environments can keep gameplay fresh.
